## Prediction of hourly rental sharing bicycle

This repository contains the source code of the Prediction model for hourly bicycle utilization.   
Details on the *hour.csv* and *day.csv* datasets can be found on *Readme.txt*.  
The Jupyter notebooks contain the corresponding files for the model development. It is organized sequentially as follows:

1. Explorative Data Analysis
2. Model Development (Feature Engineering, Scaling, Split train-test sets), Forward cross-validation
3.
    3.1 Model error (R2, MAE, MAD) using test set, feature importance  
    3.2 Export model for production, recreating a client app to conduct inference via HTTP request

To see the model error, and conduct inference of the exported model go directly to Notebook n.3.
