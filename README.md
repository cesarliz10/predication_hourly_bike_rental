## Prediction of hourly rental sharing bicycle

This repository contains the source code of the Prediction model for hourly bicycle utilization.   
Details on the *hour.csv* and *day.csv* datasets can be found on *Readme.txt*.  
The Jupyter notebooks contain the corresponding files for the model development. It is organized sequentially as follows:

- 1. Explorative Data Analysis
- 2. Model Development (Feature Engineering, Scaling, Split train-test sets), Forward cross-validation
- 3. Model error and feature importance (R2, MAE, MAD) using test set

To simply evaluate and further modify the best-trained model go directly to Notebook n.3.
